    - = Development Plan / To do list = -
- get IR tracking to work correctly
- code several different types of emulated HID, including:
    >Pitch, yaw, and roll of Wiimotes mapped into joystick X,Y, and Z
    >semi-accurate pointing device
    >rotation of controller + nunchuk joystick
    >maybe balance board mapped to joystick input
    >add method of using gesture recognition and mapping gestures to keyboard keys
    >if possible, blender addon that makes this whole application really useful
    >find good way to emulate a commercial 6DOF controller
    >if possible, enable use of two Wiimotes as VR controllers
- Design GUI interface for selection of HID method
- Optimize performance
    >Minimize processing overhead
    >consider using multi-threading to maximize poll rate
    >make performance impact as small as possible
- fix bugs
- make open source
- implement multiple methods of tracking
