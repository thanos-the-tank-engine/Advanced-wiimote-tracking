# Advanced-wiimote-tracking
A python application for tracking nintendo wii controllers in 6 degrees of freedom

**This project is still very much a WIP. very little functionality has been implemented in it, and it is nowhere near completion at this time**

This application is designed to allow you to connect wii controllers to a computer and then channel the inputs from it into various emulated HID devices.
