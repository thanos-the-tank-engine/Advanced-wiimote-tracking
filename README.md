# Advanced-wiimote-tracking
A python application for tracking nintendo wii controllers in 6 degrees of freedom

**This project is still very much a WIP. very little functionality has been implemented in it, and it is nowhere near completion at this time**

This application is designed to allow you to connect wii controllers to a computer and then channel the inputs from it into various emulated HID devices.
The goal of this software is to reduce the barrier of entry for 6DOF controller systems by enabling the use of a relatively low-cost system that can easily be DIY'd out of readily available objects. most current methods, such as the 3d-mouse style of controller, or the controllers used for a VR headset, are incredibly expensive. this software will allow you to use something that you probably have lying around, or can buy secondhand for cheap if you don't, toaccomplish the same thing.
